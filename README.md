  Vidhyadaan 
      Vidyadaan is a transformative website addressing the education gap in government schools. We extract data from ASER surveys, revealing the inadequate knowledge levels of students in subjects like Science, Mathematics, and English.

I have created the script to extract all the data about the schools.
